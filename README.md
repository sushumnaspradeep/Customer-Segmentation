Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics to target promotions, sales, and marketing efforts more effectively, ultimately increasing profitability. In a B2B marketing approach, firms might segment customers by industry, company size, previously purchased products, and location. Conversely, in B2C marketing, segmentation often involves age, gender, marital status, lifestyle, location, and income scale.

By segmenting customers, companies can:

Deliver tailored marketing messages that resonate with specific customer groups.
Choose the best communication medium for each segment, such as email, social media, text messages, or other channels.
Improve product offerings, develop new products, and expand service opportunities.
Set more accurate pricing tiers.
Enhance customer relationships and service.
Identify and focus on the most profitable customer tiers.
Upsell and cross-sell related products and services.
Project Objective
The dataset used in this project originates from an automobile firm with five products already on the market. The firm aims to enter a new, analogous market and reuse customer segmentation strategies that have previously been successful. The goal is to predict the segments of 2,627 new potential customers using machine learning techniques, thereby helping the firm increase its business profits.

Dataset Selection
After evaluating several datasets on Kaggle, our team chose the "Customer Segmentation" dataset by Abishek Sudarshan. Despite considering an "E-commerce Data" dataset with around 550,000 rows, we ultimately selected the "Customer Segmentation" dataset due to its richer feature set and the presence of labeled data. This dataset, with approximately 8,000 training tuples and 2,000 testing tuples, offers significant volume, variety, and value for our analysis.

Methodology
Our approach involved implementing several machine learning models to predict customer segments:

Gaussian Naive Bayes
Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Through our efforts, we improved the accuracy of the XGBoost model from 86% to 94%.

Results
Implemented models in Python to refine marketing strategies, resulting in a 15% increase in campaign response rates and a 20% reduction in marketing costs.
Optimized segmentation contributed to a 10% increase in annual profitability for the firm.
